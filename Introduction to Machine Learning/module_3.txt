Module 3 - Lesson One - Graded Assignment

Q1. What are sensitivity and specificity in the context of medical image diagnosis?
✅ Sensitivity is the ratio of true positives found to positives in the dataset, and specificity is the ratio of true negatives found to negatives in the dataset.
❌ Sensitivity is the ratio of true negatives found to negatives in the dataset, and specificity is the ratio of true positives found to positives in the dataset.

Q3. A high value in the convolution indicates a ____________ feature.
✅ Matched
❌ Unmatched

Q4. What is the result of convolving a filter with a two-dimensional image?
✅ A heat map, where bright spots indicate feature detection.
❌ A line drawing, where the edges are indicated by bright lines.
❌ A silhouette of the feature, if the image matches the filter.
❌ An image that is the average of the filter with the original image.

1. What is meant by “volume” of feature maps?
✅ Combining all of the feature maps for different features into a stack.
⬜ Each feature is run multiple times to form a stack.
⬜ The filter can have a stride of more than one for a smaller feature map.
⬜ Filters to identify three-dimensional information.


2. How is color accounted for in a filter?
✅ Three color channels are separated to create a volume filter.
⬜ Each filter must be at least 3x3 for the three color channels.
⬜ A volume of feature maps is fed to the next step of the network.
⬜ The color channels are averaged to form a grayscale image.


3. Which of the following are example activation functions?
✅ Sigmoid function
✅ Hyperbolic tangent function
✅ Rectified linear unit
⬜ Linear function
⬜ Sine function


4. Which of the following operations are used in pooling?
✅ Maximum
✅ Mean
⬜ Minimum
⬜ Convolution


5. What is a fully connected layer?
✅ A layer in which each data point is connected via a weight to the upstream elements.
⬜ A layer containing the feature maps of all lower-level features.
⬜ A layer that fully utilizes convolution.
⬜ A layer in which each data point is pooled to downsample the feature maps.
