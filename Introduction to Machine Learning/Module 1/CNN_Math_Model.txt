CNN Math Model – Graded Assignment

Q1. What is the outcome of convolving the layer 2 filters with the layer 1 feature maps?
❌ Layer 1 feature maps
✅ Layer 2 feature maps
❌ Layer 3 feature maps
❌ Layer 3 filters

Q2. In general terms, the basic steps to do learning are:
Obtain a large set of labeled data
[ What goes here? ]
Determine parameters that minimize the sum over loss

Which of the following best describes the missing step 2?
✅ Determine the loss function, which computes loss between true label and model label
❌ Check how well the network predicts the associated labels for new data
❌ Ask a domain expert what they think the parameters should be
❌ Pick the most representative examples of the labeled data, given the context of the data

Q3. Why is learning hard? (Choose all that are correct.)
✅ There can be many local minima, even for two parameters
✅ The parameter space is large
✅ The parameters are computationally expensive to compute
❌ The math model is new
