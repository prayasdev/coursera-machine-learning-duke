Multilayer Perceptron – Graded Assignment

Q1. Which one of the following best describes a difference between logistic regression and multilayer perceptron models?
✅ Logistic regression maps the feature vector to a single real-valued number, while multilayer perceptron maps the feature vector to multiple real-valued numbers.
❌ Multilayer perceptron maps the feature vector to a single real-valued number, while logistic regression maps the feature vector to multiple real-valued numbers.
❌ Logistic regression involves converting a single real-valued number to a probability using the sigmoid function, while multilayer perceptron does not.
❌ Multilayer perceptron involves converting a single real-valued number to a probability using the sigmoid function, while logistic regression does not.
